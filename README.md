# Design Choices and Implementation Overview:
***Approach***: I followed a Design-Driven Development approach, first crafting the UI and then building the functionality around the requirements.

***Component Design***: I leveraged Tailwind CSS to create a clean, responsive UI that's compatible with all screen sizes while keeping the codebase lightweight.

***State Management***: I implemented Redux Toolkit to maintain a centralized and predictable state across the application.

***Api Data Fetching***: Data from the TMDB API is fetched using createApi (RTK Query), a feature of Redux Toolkit for efficient and declarative API handling.
